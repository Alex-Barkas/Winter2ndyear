### MTHE281 Grading

Here is the grading scheme broken down into two options. Your final grade will be the **maximum** of these two calculations.

### Option 1: Standard Weighting
*   **Homework:** 10%
*   **Midterm 1:** 25%
*   **Midterm 2:** 25%
*   **Final Exam:** 40%

### Option 2: Final Exam Bias (Benefit of the Doubt)
*   **Homework:** 10%
*   **Lower Midterm Mark:** 10%
*   **Higher Midterm Mark:** 30%
*   **Final Exam:** 50%

> **Key Takeaway:** If you perform better on the final exam than you did on your midterms, Option 2 shifts more weight to the final (50%) and your best midterm (30%) while reducing the impact of your worst midterm.
