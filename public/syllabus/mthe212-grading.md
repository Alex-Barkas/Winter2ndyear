### MTHE212 Grading

-   Quizzes: 40%. We will have five in-class quizzes throughout the semester. Each quiz will be 50
minutes (one full class). Your lowest quiz grade will be dropped and the remaining four quizzes will each be worth 10% of your final grade

-   Final exam: 60%. There will be a final exam at the end of the semester, at a time and location to
be determined by the University Registrar. It will be cumulative (i.e., you can expect to see material from the entire course and all course learning outcomes on the exam).
